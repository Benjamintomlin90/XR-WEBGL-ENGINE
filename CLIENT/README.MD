XR-WEBGL-ENGINE-CLIENT

Required: NPM, Node.js, Docker

Please run npm install in the established folder. You can start the client with 'npm start' from the command line.
To run in a virtualized container via Docker, run the command 'docker compose up -d" from the command line.

NOTE: to run a full Unity game, the build from a local machine generated by the UnityHub software must be located/transferred to this CLIENT folder (i.e. Build/, Template/, etc.) and will differ from game to game.

Here, a sample client.js build will communicate with SERVER as a basic log-in/log-out feature to test communication (the game logic will not go through without an added Unity build).
